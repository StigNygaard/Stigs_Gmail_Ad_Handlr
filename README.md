# Stigs_Gmail_Ad_Handlr
Stig's Gmail Ad Handlr is a userscript for ~~highlighting ads on Gmail for easy recognizability~~ hiding ad-rows in Gmail webclient.
This script used to just color ads for easy recognition, but lately I repeatedly clicked slowly emerging ads by mistake.
So now this script completely hides them to avoid mistakenly clicking on them...

This is EXPERIMENTAL and it will apparently not always run when Gmail is started. I think the problem occurs when Gmail is fetched from cache.
