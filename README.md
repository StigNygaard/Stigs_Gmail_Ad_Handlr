# Stigs_Gmail_Ad_Handlr
Stig's Gmail Ad Handlr is a userscript for ~~highlighting ads on Gmail for easy recognizability~~ hiding ad-rows in Gmail webclient.
This script used to just color ads for easy recognition, but lately I repeatedly clicked slowly emerging ads by mistake.
So now this script completely hides them to avoid mistakenly clicking on them...
